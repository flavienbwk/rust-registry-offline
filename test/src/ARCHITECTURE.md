# Architecture

Panamax's main functionality is split up into two main components: Crates, and Rustup. Both of these pieces share the same functionality to download files.

Additionally when downloading files, a shared progress bar is used.

Finally, a mirror.toml file is used to configure everything.

# Starting Points

The two main commands, `init` and `sync`, are handled in the `init()` and `sync()` commands in mirror.rs.

## Main Components 

### Crates

The crates component is split up into two files: `crates_index.rs` for handling the crates.io-index git repository, and `crates.rs` for the crates files themselves.

### Rustup

The rustup component is covered in `rustup.rs`. This includes functionality to download the rustup-init files, as well as the libraries and components required for the various Rust versions.

## Shared Components

### Download

All details related to downloading (or more specifically, HTTP downloading) is covered in `download.rs`. This includes functionality such as retrying on failed downloads.

### Progress Bar

When a mirror is downloading or updating, a progress bar is displayed. This file includes some common features of all progress bars within Panamax. This is covered in `progress_bar.rs`.

### Mirror Configuration

All details related to configuration file management is handled in `mirror.rs`. Serde is used to parse the `mirror.toml` file, with the root being the `Mirror` struct.
